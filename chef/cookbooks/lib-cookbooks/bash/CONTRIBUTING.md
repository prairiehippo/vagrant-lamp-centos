# Contributing

For my projects, all I care about are the following:

## Acceptable Etiquette

1. Fork the repository on Github
2. Create a branch with a topical name for your change
3. Make small stable commits
4. Update tests for changed code
5. Write new tests for new code
6. Make a pull request

## Bonus Points

1. Create an issue first to discuss the feature with me and others
2. Update documentation along with your changes.  This may need to happen after the pull request is merged in.
3. Split your pull requests up in smaller units of work so we can pick and choose what we want to merge, and what we want to improve.
4. Always make your pull request improve the code

That's all I have, enjoy.
